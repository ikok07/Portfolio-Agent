- **Purpose**: Offers training to become an IT specialist with skills equivalent to 5+ years of experience, without requiring prior experience or expensive courses.
- **Content**: Provides step-by-step guidance for aspiring IT professionals.
- **Website Features**: Includes a form for users to submit their name, email, and phone number to engage with the academy. The form uses JavaScript (React) for submission, interacting with an API endpoint (https://api.imnextgen.bg/test/submit).[](https://academy.imnextgen.bg/)

### Technical Details
- **Form Functionality** (from academy.imnextgen.bg):
    - Uses React for dynamic form handling.
    - Collects user input (name, email, phone) and submits it to an API.
    - Includes error handling for invalid fields or failed API requests.
    - Example code snippet for form submission:
      ```javascript
      async function submitForm(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        if (!nameInput || !emailInput || !phoneInput) throw new Error("Invalid fields!");
        const res = await fetch("https://api.imnextgen.bg/test/submit");
        if (res.ok) { console.log(await res.json()) } else { throw new Error(`An error occurred!`) }
      }
      ```
    - The form is designed to avoid using `<form onSubmit>` due to sandboxing restrictions, instead relying on button click events.[](https://academy.imnextgen.bg/)
